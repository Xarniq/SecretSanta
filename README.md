# Secret Santa Assignment with PHPMailer

This is a simple PHP-based Secret Santa assignment script that uses PHPMailer to send assignment emails to participants. The assignment is done randomly, and each participant receives an email with the name of the person they are assigned to gift.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, you need to set up a Gmail account and generate an App Password for secure email sending.

2. **Enable Less Secure Apps:** Go to your [Google Account Security settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup) and enable "Less secure app access."

3. **Generate App Password:** Create an App Password for this script. Follow [Google's instructions](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) to generate an App Password. Use this password as your email password in the script.
